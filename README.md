CortexCodec is a project led by Grace He and Tanisha Mandal with NeuroTech@UIUC. 

We are creating a custom SVM/KNN machine learning model to classify emotions using EEG data. By aiming to increase the accuracy of our model and trialing a novel Neurable EEG headset, we aim to improve the accessibility of wellness therapy by minimizing the subjective elements in therapy and instead using more reliable emotion recognition tools like ours.

This repository holds homework assignments my co-project manager and I created for our project members to grow more familiar with EEG preprocessing and classification in Python. The paper we referenced for HW#1 is cited at the top of the scripts.

There are two versions of each homework, the full script and the version with blanks. The full script is the entire code, while the versions with blanks are intended for our members to complete on their own so they can better understand preprocessing and machine learning pipelines.
