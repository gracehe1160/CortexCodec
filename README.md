This repository holds homework assignments my co-project manager and I created for our project members to grow more familiar with EEG preprocessing and classification in Python. The papers we reference are always cited at the top of the scripts.

The "AnswerKey" files are the full scripts, while the "HW#_" files have blanks for our members to fill in.
